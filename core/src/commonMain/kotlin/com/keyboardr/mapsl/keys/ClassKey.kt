/**
 * A [ServiceKey] that uses the service's own [KClass] as its identifier.
 *
 * This key kind is useful for the common case where you only need a single instance of a service
 * and can identify it by its type alone, without needing to declare an explicit key instance.
 *
 * All `ClassKey` implementations for the same service type `T` are considered equal. This allows,
 * for example, a service to be registered with a [LazyClassKey] and later retrieved using a
 * [SingletonClassKey] for the same type.
 *
 * > **Warning on Type Erasure**: Due to JVM type erasure, it is not advisable to use `ClassKey`
 * > with generic types (e.g., `List<String>`). The key's identity is based on the erased
 * > type (`List` in this case), meaning `ClassKey<List<String>>` and `ClassKey<List<Int>>`
 * > would be treated as the same key. For generic services, use explicit [LazyKey] or
 * > [SingletonKey] instances instead.
